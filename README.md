# Projects
### Machine Learning and NLP
* [Synthetic Query Translation](https://github.com/dylanshih1/synthetic-query-translation)
* * Starting phase of research project on Cross Language Information Retrieval
  * Takes a natural language question as input, returns a string resembling a search query (i.e. stopword removal, lemmatizing, etc.)
  * Uses NLP-related Python libraries such as Stanza
* [Le Sserafind](https://github.com/jamnavarro/bitcamp)
* * Bitcamp 2024 Machine Learning Track project
  * Contains a dataset we created of pictures of each member of KPOP group Le Sserafim
  * Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify which member is in a photo provided by the user
  * Utilized libraries such as Pytorch
* [Pokemon CLIR](https://github.com/irelandparrish/pokemon_clir)
* * Uses pre-existing translation services to translate a search query from English into Japanese or vice versa and returns the Wikipedia results retrieved from the translated search query
  * Cross Language Information Retrieval project
### Software Engineering
* [ReciPlease](https://reciplease-ooseteam-02.vercel.app/)
* * A 'PERN' (MERN but with Prisma) project focused on making recipes more accessible
* [SyllaJay](https://github.com/Scesar1/SyllaJay)
* * HopHacks 2023 project that parses through course syllabi
